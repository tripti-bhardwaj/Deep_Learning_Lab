## Objective
The objective of this lab was to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. We explored different configurations by experimenting with:
 - 3 Activation Functions
- 3 Weight Initialization Techniques
- 3 Optimizers

Additionally, we compared our best CNN model for both datasets with a pretrained ResNet-18 model.
